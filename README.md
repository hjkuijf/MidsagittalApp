# MidsagittalApp
MidsagittalApp: to compute the midsagittal plane and surface on brain images.

If you use this software anywhere, I would appreciate if you cite the following article:

H.J. Kuijf, S.J. van Veluw, M.I. Geerlings, M.A. Viergever, G.J. Biessels, K.L. Vincken, "Automatic extraction of the midsagittal surface from brain MR images using the Kullback-Leibler measure", Neuroinformatics, 2014, nr. 3, vol. 12, pp. 395-403. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12021-013-9215-0

## Instructions
The code uses the self-contained project structure introduced in [MeVisLab](http://www.mevislab.de/) 2.7. To use this in your own projects, please do the following:

1. Create a new project in one of your packages
2. Download the source code and put it in the project
3. Download the dependencies [ALGLIB](https://github.com/hjkuijf/ALGLIB) and [dlib](https://github.com/hjkuijf/dlib).
4. Compile all sources

## Usage
The main application is the module MidsagittalApp, which should be self-explanatory. Other modules have an associated Help-file.
