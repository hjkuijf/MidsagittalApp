Kuijf, S.J. van Veluw, M.I. Geerlings, M.A. Viergever, G.J. Biessels, K.L. Vincken, \"Automatic extraction of the midsagittal surface from brain MR images using the Kullback-Leibler measure\", Neuroinformatics, 2014, nr. 3, vol. 12, pp. 395-403. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12021-013-9215-0\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nThe code uses the self-contained project structure introduced in [MeVisLab](http://www.mevislab.de/) 2.7. To use this in your own projects, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project in one of your packages\r\n2. Download the source code and put it in the project\r\n3. Download the dependencies [ALGLIB](https://github.com/hjkuijf/ALGLIB) and [dlib](https://github.com/hjkuijf/dlib).\r\n4. Compile all sources\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe main application is the module MidsagittalApp, which should be self-explanatory. Other modules have an associated Help-file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
